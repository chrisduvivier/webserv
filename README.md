## Starting point (Prep + Resources)
Read fantastic [guide](https://www.notion.so/Documentation-Webserv-320727979ffd4176a7dd5ba41aaadf46) made by former 42 students (written in French). Some take away from this guide:
- [How to build a web client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdIiTxtMaKA&list=PL9IEJIKnBJjH_zM5LnovnoaKlXML5qh17&index=2) (Our `tcpclient.c` in the POC/mini_client folder is based on this video)
- [How to build a web server]: see POC in the documentation
- [How to select for having non-blocking server]: see POC in the documentation
